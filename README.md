# Python DSA Projects

## Description

This repository serves as a curated collection of DSA-focused projects developed in Python.
Each project is designed to practice specific programming skills and concepts, making this an ideal resource for my learning and development.

## Projects

- [Blossom](./Blossom/README.md) - Implements a hash map using linked lists to manage collisions.
- [A Sorted Tale](./SortedTale/README.md) - Compares the performance of bubble sort and quick sort algorithms using Python.
- [Towers of Hanoi](./TowersOfHanoi/README.md) - Solves the Towers of Hanoi problem using object-oriented programming and the concept of stacks.
- [The Boredless Tourist](./TheBoredlessTourist/README.md) - Demonstrates list management, function definitions, and data structuring in Python.
- [Scrabble](./Scrabble/README.md) - Provides a Python implementation for calculating the point value of a word in the game of Scrabble.
- [Longest Common Subsequence](./LongestCommonSubsequence/README.md) - Provides a Python implementation for finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two strings.
- [SkyRoute](./Skyroute/README.md) - A Python-based application for finding the shortest metro route between various landmarks using Graph traversals.
- [Travelling Salesperson Solver](./TravellingSalesperson/README.md) - A Python application designed to solve the classic optimization problem using a Greedy Algorithm.
